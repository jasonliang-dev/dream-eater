;;; Commentary:

;; Acknowledge Dreamweaver's check in/out lock files

;; When this mode is enabled, all new buffers will be opened in read
;; only mode.  To make the buffer writable and create a lock file for
;; Dreamweaver users to see, run `dream-eater/check-out'.  To remove
;; the lock file and remove write access, run `dream-eater/check-in'.

;;; Code:

(defvar dream-eater/check-out-name "emacs")
(defvar dream-eater/email "example@domain.com")

(defvar dream-eater--checked-out-list '()
  "Store the list of all files checked out.")

;; store functions as dream eater mode fsets them
;; so they don't get lost after dream eater mode is disabled
